    "synopsis": "Madoka Kaname and Sayaka Miki are regular middle school girls with regular lives, but all that changes when they encounter Kyuubey, a cat-like magical familiar, and Homura Akemi, the new transfer student.\n\nKyuubey offers them a proposition: he will grant any one of their wishes and in exchange, they will each become a magical girl, gaining enough power to fulfill their dreams. However, Homura Akemi, a magical girl herself, urges them not to accept the offer, stating that everything is not what it seems.\n\nA story of hope, despair, and friendship, Mahou Shoujo Madoka\u2605Magica deals with the difficulties of being a magical girl and the price one has to pay to make a dream come true.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
    "background": "Mahou Shoujo Madoka\u2605Magica has garnered widespread critical acclaim, particularly in regards to its subversive approach toward the magical girl subgenre. In a 2012 interview, series writer Gen Urobuchi remarks that the original story was influenced by Hidamari Sketch, Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha, and Le Portrait de Petite Cossette. The series has received various awards and nominations since its release. In 2011, it won the Grand Prize for Animation at the 15th Japan Media Arts Awards; the Television Award at the 16th Animation Kobe Awards; and 12 Newtype awards. In 2012, it won the 43rd Seiun Award for Best Media as well as the Television Award at the 11th Tokyo Anime Awards. Released on Blu-ray and DVD in six volumes in Japan from April 27, 2011 to September 21, 2011, the anime was considered a commercial success, with each volume selling over 50,000 copies. It was also released in the same formats in North America by Aniplex from February 14, 2012 to June 12, 2012, spanning three volumes. The company later released a Blu-ray complete box set on September 27, 2016. The series has received multiple video game adaptations and cameos in other media.",

    "synopsis": "Ayumu Aikawa is a 16-year-old high school student who is tragically murdered while investigating a suspicious house. However, he soon awakens next to a strange armored girl called Eucliwood Hellscythe. She reveals herself to be a necromancer who has revived Ayumu, consequently turning him into a zombie! \n\nNow immortal, Ayumu sets out to hunt down his killer. One day, while searching in a cemetery, he encounters a boisterous young girl named Haruna, who is fighting a bear with a chainsaw while dressed as a magical girl. After she kills the beast, Haruna attempts to erase Ayumu's memories of her, but he instead absorbs her magic for himself. Stripped of her powers, Haruna now orders Ayumu to take up her role of hunting strange creatures known as \"Megalo,\" monsters that roam the human world and terrorize the population.\n\nKore wa Zombie Desu ka? follows the daily antics of the human-turned-zombie Ayumu as he begins his new, ludicrous life where the supernatural becomes the norm.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

However, his focus soon changes as he becomes curious about a golden strand of hair on the stairs. The steps lead him to a large garden and a beautiful doll-like girl known as Victorique de Blois, whose complex and imaginative foresight allows her to predict their futures, now intertwined.\n\nWith more mysteries quickly developing\u2014including the appearance of a ghost ship and an alchemist with the power of transmutation\u2014Victorique and Kujou, bound by fate and their unique skills, have no choice but to rely on each other.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

These inhuman beings leave devastation in their wake whenever they appear, with the efforts to stave them off becoming known as Nova Clashes. Young women known as \"Pandoras\" and young men known as \"Limiters\" are implanted with stigmata to give them superhuman powers and are trained in military academies, where they must learn to work together if humanity is to have a chance of surviving.\n\nFreezing tells the story of Kazuya Aoi as he sets out for his first day at the West Genetics military academy, right when a battle royale is being undertaken by the Pandoras. It is here that he mistakes Satellizer el Bridget\u2014a powerful Pandora known as the \"Untouchable Queen\"\u2014as his deceased sister and embraces her. Though he costs her the match, she finds that his touch doesn't drive her away and decides to take him as her Limiter.

Despite the visions never appearing clear or concrete, he is able to predict them by sensing the person's \"aura.\" Normally, this skill is a fun trick to play on his classmates, but Yumeji only ever sees himself having the same nightmare every night.\n\nTo his surprise, the nightmare continues in the middle of the day even before Yumeji has fallen asleep. The unexpected event was triggered by a dream demon\u2014an inhabitant of the world of dreams who wants to use Yumeji's body as a vessel to fully enter the real world. However, Yumeji is saved by the timely arrival of Merry Nightmare, another dream demon who can somehow physically manifest without a host and is instead trying to return to her own realm.\n\nAs more dream demons continue to push into reality, it is up to Yumeji and Merry to fight back against the invasion before everyone's nightmares materialize.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Fortunately, Shuuichi has a childhood friend who has similar feelings of discomfort related to gender identity: the lanky tomboy Yoshino Takatsuki, who, though biologically female, does not identify as a girl. These two friends share a similar secret and find solace in one another; however, their lives become even more complicated when they must tread the unfamiliar waters of a new school, attempt to make new friends, and struggle to maintain old ones. Faced with nearly insurmountable odds, they must learn to deal with the harsh realities of growing up, being transgender, relationships, and acceptance.\n\nLauded as a decidedly serious take on gender identity and LGBT struggles, Takako Shimura's Hourou Musuko is about Shuuichi and Yoshino's attempts to discover their true selves as they enter puberty, make friends, fall in love, and face some very real and difficult choices.",
    "background": "Please note that this series was 11 episodes when aired on TV but 12 episodes when it was released on BD & DVD. See more info for further details.

    "synopsis": "Tokyo-born schoolboy Yukitaka Tsutsui is moving to Yamagata Prefecture for high school on a baseball scholarship. Since he went to the top middle school in Japan for baseball, the townsfolk are very excited about his arrival. However, when he arrives in his apartment, he encounters a strange man nonchalantly reading and wearing his clothes! The stranger claims to be an alien who crash-landed on Earth and has nowhere to go. Revealing himself to be Baka Ki El Dogra, the crown prince of the planet Dogra, he is just one of the hundreds of aliens that have already made Earth their home.\n\nDespite his regal origins, the prince is an infamous intergalactic fool who thinks nothing of inconveniencing others for his own amusement. Whether he is running ridiculous tests on his subordinates, giving strange powers to random children, or just generally being a nuisance, nobody is safe from the idiot prince's antics!\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

On June 19, 2011, Mutsumi Akazaki, who drew the manga adaptation of Fractale, stated in a blog post that she found the work 'uninteresting' and added that she wanted to work on a manga that she enjoyed. The blog post was soon removed. As a result, the anime's director Yutaka Yamamoto requested that the production committee discontinue the manga series, though there was no indication that this was approved. Akazaki later apologised for the remark.",

    "synopsis": "Taking the world by storm, the card game Cardfight Vanguard has influenced many to integrate card games into their everyday lives. Players of the popular game are called \"cardfighters,\" and they frequently battle each other in card shops. The game has inspired many people, one of which is the quiet and timid Aichi Sendou who is often ridiculed and bullied by his peers. Whenever he feels down, he takes a glance at Blaster Blade\u2014a legendary rare card given to him when he was young\u2014and gains the motivation to move on with his life. \n\nHowever, one day, school bully Katsumi Morikawa notices Aichi's treasure and snatches the card away from him. After a turn of events, Aichi soon discovers that the card is now in the hands of Toshiki Kai, a cardfighter who has become the strongest in town despite having only recently arrived. To make matters worse, Kai refuses to return the card unless Aichi defeats him in a cardfight. \n\nMuch to everyone's surprise, Aichi rises up to the occasion. As he musters up his courage and pictures himself winning this decisive battle, Aichi begins to find his way into the adventurous world of Cardfight Vanguard. \n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

During an annual concert event, Hummy, the cat songstress of Major Land, prepares to sing the \"Melody of Happiness,\" capable of spreading happiness to worlds beyond. However, Mephisto, the king of Minor Land, interrupts the event and rewrites the score into the \"Melody of Sorrow\"\u2014a dissonant composition that would instead cause despair when performed. In order to prevent this from happening, Hummy is tasked with finding the Precure, renowned warriors with an unmatched passion for music, and recreating the Melody of Happiness.\n\nHummy arrives in Kanon Town, home of musically-inclined athlete Hibiki Houjou and studious baker Kanade Minamino. Engaging only in endless bickers, Hibiki and Kanade were formerly best friends and have since fallen out of touch. Their activities are stopped short by an unwelcome guest\u2014the songstress of Minor Land, Siren. \n\nWhen Siren turns an important record into a gigantic monster, the girls' hearts resonate with the desire to protect what they hold dear and the two transform into the Suite Precure! As legendary warriors, Hibiki and Kanade will have to put their personal squabbles aside if they wish to protect the happiness of the world.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

    "synopsis": "Oscar is a lizard living in a non-specific desert that has features from several different real deserts, like the Sahara, Kalahari Desert, and North American deserts. An asphalt concrete highway runs through the area, used from time to time by various cargo trucks. Oscar is generally searching for food or water; he sometimes discovers liquid, in bottles or elsewhere, but is usually frustrated from recovering it for drink. An oasis supplies the only fresh water in the area, but its thick population of irascible and hungry crocodiles renders it inaccessible. At considerable personal risk (lizard is a delicacy for chickens), Oscar occasionally manages to steal an egg from a nearby hen coop, and he sometimes explores one of the piles of trash that litter the parched landscape. Popy, a fennec fox; Buck, a vulture; and Harchi, a hyena, inhabit a derelict school bus situated on a neighboring hill, but they mostly race about on a cast-off warehouse or grocery cart powered by Harchi and directed by Popy. Like Oscar, the trio constantly search for food and water - often competing with him, sometimes abusing him as a means, but occasionally cooperating with him when it suits their purpose. The main characters often find themselves falling off cliffs a la Wile E. Coyote chasing the Road Runner, wherein the law of gravity is briefly suspended while the character comes to realize their imminent doom.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)",
