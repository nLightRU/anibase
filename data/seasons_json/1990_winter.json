    "background": "Kyattou Ninden Teyandee was adapted into the English-language series Samurai Pizza Cats by Saban Entertainment in 1991. This version features a completely original plot and runs for 52 episodes. The series is currently available to stream on Peacock; it was released on DVD and Blu-ray by Discotek Media on DVD on July 30, 2013 and on January 19, 2016 respectively. Discotek also licensed the original version of the series in 2013, releasing it separately on DVD on April 30, 2013. A video game based on Kyattou Ninden Teyandee was developed and published by Tecmo for the Nintendo Entertainment System in 1991. While the game was only officially released in Japan, a fan-made patch was created, including a complete English adaptation that replaces elements of the original series with ones corresponding with Samurai Pizza Cats.",

The two main characters are Abel and Tialah. Tialah receives the legendary Red Stone from the Aliahan Village sage Master Yogi. Soon after, Tialah is kidnapped by the evil Baramos who wants to use the Red Stone to resurrect The Great Dragon and be granted eternal life. Abel swore to rescue Tialah and he is given the Blue Stone, which can only seal the Dragon once it has been released. \n\n(Source: AniDB)",
