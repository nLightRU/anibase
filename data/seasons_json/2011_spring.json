    "synopsis": "Eccentric scientist Rintarou Okabe has a never-ending thirst for scientific exploration. Together with his ditzy but well-meaning friend Mayuri Shiina and his roommate Itaru Hashida, Rintarou founds the Future Gadget Laboratory in the hopes of creating technological innovations that baffle the human psyche. Despite claims of grandeur, the only notable \"gadget\" the trio have created is a microwave that has the mystifying power to turn bananas into green goo.\n\nHowever, when Rintarou decides to attend neuroscientist Kurisu Makise's conference on time travel, he experiences a series of strange events that lead him to believe that there is more to the \"Phone Microwave\" gadget than meets the eye. Apparently able to send text messages into the past using the microwave, Rintarou dabbles further with the \"time machine,\" attracting the ire and attention of the mysterious organization SERN.\n\nDue to the novel discovery, Rintarou and his friends find themselves in an ever-present danger. As he works to mitigate the damage his invention has caused to the timeline, he is not only fighting a battle to save his loved ones, but also one against his degrading sanity.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

    "synopsis": "Humans and demons are two sides of the same coin, as are Assiah and Gehenna, their respective worlds. The only way to travel between the realms is by the means of possession, like in ghost stories. However, Satan, the ruler of Gehenna, cannot find a suitable host to possess and therefore, remains imprisoned in his world. In a desperate attempt to conquer Assiah, he sends his son instead, intending for him to eventually grow into a vessel capable of possession by the demon king.\n\nAo no Exorcist follows Rin Okumura who appears to be an ordinary, somewhat troublesome teenager\u2014that is until one day he is ambushed by demons. His world turns upside down when he discovers that he is in fact the very son of Satan and that his demon father wishes for him to return so they can conquer Assiah together. Not wanting to join the king of Gehenna, Rin decides to begin training to become an exorcist so that he can fight to defend Assiah alongside his brother Yukio.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

    "synopsis": "Jinta Yadomi is peacefully living as a recluse, spending his days away from school and playing video games at home instead. One hot summer day, his childhood friend, Meiko \"Menma\" Honma, appears and pesters him to grant a forgotten wish. He pays her no mind, which annoys her, but he doesn't really care. After all, Menma already died years ago.\n\nAt first, Jinta thinks that he is merely hallucinating due to the summer heat, but he is later on convinced that what he sees truly is the ghost of Menma. Jinta and his group of childhood friends grew apart after her untimely death, but they are drawn together once more as they try to lay Menma's spirit to rest. Re-living their pain and guilt, will they be able to find the strength to help not only Menma move on\u2014but themselves as well?\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

    "synopsis": "After a one-year hiatus, Shinpachi Shimura returns to Edo, only to stumble upon a shocking surprise: Gintoki and Kagura, his fellow Yorozuya members, have become completely different characters! Fleeing from the Yorozuya headquarters in confusion, Shinpachi finds that all the denizens of Edo have undergone impossibly extreme changes, in both appearance and personality. Most unbelievably, his sister Otae has married the Shinsengumi chief and shameless stalker Isao Kondou and is pregnant with their first child.\n\nBewildered, Shinpachi agrees to join the Shinsengumi at Otae and Kondou's request and finds even more startling transformations afoot both in and out of the ranks of the the organization. However, discovering that Vice Chief Toushirou Hijikata has remained unchanged, Shinpachi and his unlikely Shinsengumi ally set out to return the city of Edo to how they remember it.\n\nWith even more dirty jokes, tongue-in-cheek parodies, and shameless references, Gintama' follows the Yorozuya team through more of their misadventures in the vibrant, alien-filled world of Edo.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Still stuck in his contract with the demon Elsie, he must continue to utilize the knowledge he has gained from mastering multitudes of dating simulators and chase out the phantoms that reside within by capturing the hearts of that which he hates most: three-dimensional girls.\n\nHowever, the God of Conquest has his work cut out for him. From exorcising karate practitioners and student teachers to the arrival of Elsie's best friend from Hell, he is up against a wide array of girls that will test his wit and may even take him by surprise. Though he would much rather stick to the world of 2D, he is trapped in lousy reality, and so Keima must trudge forward in his conquest of love.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

One particular Butei is Kinji Tooyama, an anti-social and curt sophomore dropout who was once a student of the combat-centric Assault Division. Kinji now lives a life of leisure studying logistics in order to cover up his powerful but embarrassing special ability. However, his peaceful days soon come to an end when he becomes the target of the infamous \"Butei Killer,\" and runs into an emotional hurricane and outspoken prodigy of the highest rank, Aria Holmes Kanzaki, who saves Kinji's life and demands that he become her partner after seeing what he is truly capable of.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

In a country whose economy is in shambles, second-year economics university student Kimimaro Yoga understands this fact all too well, as he is surrounded by the relatively luxurious lives of his peers and struggling to make ends meet. However, his world is turned on its head when a stranger in a top hat arrives one late night at his door.\n\nGoing by the name Masakaki, the visitor petitions Yoga to come to the Eastern Financial District, a place where money flows in abundance if one offers their \"future\" as collateral. Although reluctant, greed triumphs reason and Yoga accepts the offer, thus taking on the mantle of an Entre. But unbeknownst to him, the land of wealth he has entered is an alternate realm built in the likeness of his own, where Entres are forced to participate in weekly duels called Deals, with their collateral at stake. Pitted against his countrymen and fate, Yoga must quickly adapt in this new world if he hopes to protect his fortune and future\u2014and discover just how much money is truly worth.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

    "synopsis": "Makoto Niwa meticulously tallies the amount of positive and negative youthful experiences he engages in as if to grade his own life. When his parents go overseas, he moves to a new town to live with his aunt, welcoming the change and ready for a fresh start. However, as ordinary as he had imagined his adolescence to be, he could never have taken the existence of an enigmatic long-lost cousin into account.\n\nUpon moving into his aunt's house, he discovers the cousin he never knew about: Erio Touwa. Despite being Makoto's age, she couldn't be more different: Erio chooses to wrap herself in a futon all day rather than to go to school. She even claims to be an alien, and with a speech pattern and personality to back it up, any chance of Makoto's dreamt-of normal life is instantly tossed out the window.\n\nAs he meets a string of other eccentric girls in town, Makoto must face the possibility of seeing his youth points in the red. However, he might be surprised by how thrilling an abnormal youth can be.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

A unique organized group of NEXT appear regularly on Hero TV, where they chase down evildoers to bring limelight to their sponsors and earn Hero Points in the hopes of becoming the next \"King of Heroes.\"\n\nKotetsu T. Kaburagi, known as \"Wild Tiger,\" is a veteran hero whose performance has been dwindling as of late, partially due to his inability to cooperate with other heroes. After a disappointing season in which most of the other heroes far outperformed Tiger, he is paired up with a brand new hero who identifies himself by his real name\u2014Barnaby Brooks Jr.\n\nBarnaby, nicknamed \"Bunny\" by his frivolous new partner, quickly makes it clear that the two could not be more different. Though they mix as well as oil and water, Tiger and Bunny must learn to work together, both for the sake of their careers and to face the looming threats within Stern Bild.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Many of their days are spent in the clubroom slacking off, but when there is something to be done, they give their all to help others\u2014usually in sincere, but unintentionally hilarious, ways. The SKET Brigade do all they can to provide support, kindness, encouragement, and troubleshooting to any students crazy enough to ask for their services.  \n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

    "synopsis": "After having to deal with jealousy from his co-workers for working under his father's name, prideful literary editor Ritsu Onodera is determined to establish himself in the industry. To accomplish this, he quits his job at his father's publishing company and transfers to Marukawa Publishing. But instead of being placed in their literary division, Ritsu finds himself working as the rookie manga editor for the Emerald editing department, a team that operates under extremely tight schedules in order to meet deadlines. There, Ritsu is introduced to the infamous editor-in-chief Masamune Takano, a persistent man who strives for results.\n\nAs it turns out, Takano is actually Ritsu's high school love, and it is the aftermath of that heartbreak has caused Ritsu's reluctance to fall in love again. Now with the two reunited after several years of separation, the reestablishment of their relationship is marked by Takano's vow to make Ritsu say that he loves him again.\n\nSekaiichi Hatsukoi follows three couples that are interconnected within the manga industry, with each being subject to the budding of first love. \n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

    "synopsis": "Owing to an increasing debt, Kaiji Itou ends up resuming his old lifestyle. One day, while walking on the street, he stumbles upon Yuuji Endou, who is hunting Kaiji due to the money he owes to the Teiai Group. Unaware of this, Kaiji eagerly follows Endou, hoping for a chance to participate in another gamble, but soon finds out the loan shark's real intentions when he is kidnapped.\n\nGiven that Kaiji is unable to pay off his huge debt, the Teiai Group instead sends him to work in an underground labor camp. He is told that he will have to live in this hell for 15 years, alongside other debtors, until he can earn his freedom. His only hope to put an early end to this nightmare is by saving enough money to be able to go back to the surface for a single day. Once he is there, he plans to obtain the remaining money needed to settle his account by making a high-stakes wager. However, as many temptations threaten his scarce income, Kaiji may have to resort to gambling sooner than he had expected.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

    "synopsis": "Dog Days takes place in the world of Flonyard, an alternate Earth inhabited by beings who resemble humans, but also have the ears and tails of specific animals. The Republic of Biscotti, a union of dog-like citizens, has come under attack by the feline forces of the Galette Leo Knights. In an effort to save Biscotti, Princess Millhiore summons a champion from another world in order to defend her people. That champion is Cinque Izumi, a normal junior high student from Earth.\n\nAgreeing to assist Biscotti, Cinque retrieves a sacred weapon called the Palladion and prepares for war. In Flonyard, wars are fought with no casualties and are more akin to sports competitions with the goal of raising money for the participating kingdoms. Cinque is successful in his role as Biscotti\u2019s champion, but learns that a summoned champion cannot be returned to their home world. The scientists of Biscotti will endeavor to find a way for Cinque to return home, but until they figure something out, he must serve Princess Millhiore by continuing to fight as Biscotti\u2019s hero.",

    "synopsis": "Kazuma Hoshino is preparing himself for a new stage of his life as a teenager. Because of his brother Ayumu's weaker than average health, their parents thought it best for the family to move out from the city to a more rural environment. Now the two brothers are off to the Yorozuyo Inn where they\u2019ll be staying until their parents can settle affairs back in the city and set up their new home.\n\nTheir arrival to the inn doesn't go as planned though when they catch the wrong bus, wind up in the middle of nowhere, Ayumu gets his hat stolen by a wild monkey, and Kazuma gets lost in the woods trying to track the animal down. It all leads to a chance encounter with a spirited young girl named Ui, who Kazuma ends up accidentally falling onto and kissing while she tries leading him back to the bus stop. This hardly sits well with Ui\u2019s friend Ibuki who swiftly kicks Kazuma and sends him on his way. Much to Kazuma's continued horror, his bad luck is perpetuated at the inn thanks to its landlady Senka and her slightly perverted sense of humor, and then finding out that two of his classmates are the girls he embarrassed himself in front of back in the woods!\n\nHoshizora e Kakaru Hashi finds Kazuma adapting to his new school, dealing with the multiple women who have entered his life, providing emotional support for his younger brother, and coping with living with his new landlady. However, for some reason, something about this place is bringing whispers of the past into Kazuma's mind. Small flashes back to a more innocent time and a friendship long forgotten. What could this d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu mean?",

This means succubi are required to keep a harem of men close at hand. Ironically, Lotte despises men, which will put her life at risk once she matures. To convince her to fulfill her duties, one of her attendants, Judith Snorrevik, goes to the human realm to find a human male whom Lotte can tolerate.\n\nJudith returns with 23-year-old Naoya Touhara, a single father who unfortunately leaves his daughter, Asuha, behind in the human realm. As the first member of Lotte's harem, Naoya quickly adapts to this new environment, serving the princess to make her happy, rather than viewing her with sexual intent. Unfortunately, when his daughter is allowed to arrive in the magical realm, Naoya's relationship quickly worsens with Lotte. Even so, he strives to patch up their relationship.\n\nIt soon becomes clear, however, that Naoya's presence in the magical realm is more than just mere coincidence. As he develops his bond with Lotte, fate begins to pull together the connections that tie him and everyone else within this enchanting world.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

    "synopsis": "Haneda Takashi has a secret he cannot speak of. To leave his dull school-life, he was supposed to have escaped to another world. However, he is reeled in by certain ties on his heart. One of these is Kobato, his awkward younger sister. The other is Watarai Asuka, his negligent girlfriend.\n\nChitose Shuusuke is a poor freeloader. He passes his days working at various part-time jobs. One day, he has a disastrous first encounter with Tamaizumi Hiyoko. The next time they meet, Shuusuke discovers that they are fellow employees at his part-time job.\n\nNarita Hayato sees himself as a \"hard-boiled\" person. Back-breaking jobs are nothing to him. Hayato shuns normal human contact, but, during the nights, he would get together with delinquents and other denizens of the night. One such night, he meets the cheerful and oblivious Otori Naru.\n\nThe relationships with these girls will greatly affect these 3 young men. But what, exactly, is the relationship these young men have with each other?\n\n(Source: AnimeNFO)",

Due to his love for soccer, he decides to join the school soccer team, which gained its reputation after the amazing performance shown ten years earlier in the Football Frontier International, a tournament that hosts the best youth teams the world has to offer. Unfortunately, the once renowned school doesn't have the soccer spirit it once enjoyed.\n\nThis is primarily due to the fact that soccer in Japan is now controlled by a dark entity known as the \"Fifth Sector.\" They alone decide the fate of every match, instructing teams to either win or lose. The actions of the Fifth Sector have beaten down the country\u2019s soccer teams, who no longer have a love for the game.\n\nTenma and his teammates will look to shift this paradigm and fight back against their evil oppressors. Thankfully, they will not be alone in this battle, as they will get help from a group known as the \"Resistance.\" Cheer on the boys of Inazuma Eleven Go as they fight the good fight!",

Sadly, due to his lackluster dueling skills, this dream is far from achievable. But when the school bully, Ryouga \"Shark\" Kamishiro, splits the key given to him by his father into two pieces, he inadvertently sets Yuuma on a collision course with his dream.\n\nRetaining one half of the key, Yuuma begins a duel with Shark, but soon realizes that his inexperienced skills are no match for him. In a sudden turn of events, Yuuma's key repairs itself, and the \"Door of Destiny'' appears before him. Using the key to open it, Yuuma is greeted by an alien by the name of Astral\u2014a being only he can see. \n\nThe bewildered Yuuma soon learns that his memories have been divided into 100 \"Number Cards,\" all of which he must retrieve. However, he is also not the only one looking for them. Bombarded by these revelations, Yuuma, alongside Astral, must defend the world from the upcoming threats that loom over Heartland City\u2014regardless of any divine intervention that may occur. \n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

    "synopsis": "Bakugan Interspace is a virtual reality system, where players can brawl against each other and take part in tournaments. Initially designed to help practice and enhance Bakugan skills, it quickly became a meeting place for many enthusiasts. During one of Danma Kuusou's duels, the Interspace crashes, and he gets knocked out cold. Before regaining consciousness, he experiences a vision of Bakugan at war with each other once again.\n\nThe explosion of energy that accompanied Danma's fight and caused the shutdown of the system sends shock waves across the galaxy, attracting the attention of the Twelve Orders, a Gundalian organization. They infiltrate Bakugan Interspace, looking for strong brawlers to join them in their upcoming war with another alien race, the Neathians.\n\nDanma and his companions\u2014Shun Kazami and Chouji Marukura\u2014soon find themselves caught up in an extraterrestrial war. However, distant as it may seem, the conflict threatens the very sovereignty of Earth and the future of the Bakugan race as well.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

However, Yoshino sees a blue light coming from inside the Shrine and looks inside to find a mysterious person performing a magic spell. In a stroke of bad luck, Yoshino trips on a small bell and crashes into the shrine, prompting the stranger to catch her. Upon Yoshino's capture, the magic spell spirals out of control and sends Yoshino back in time to the Sengoku Era.\n\nYoshino then encounters Akechi Mitsuhide and Oda Nobunaga. But unlike what really happened during the era, Hideyoshino realizes that everyone in the world is female. She then decides to help Oda Nobunaga find the Crimson Armor which is said to allow the person wearing the armor to conquer all of Japan.",

    "synopsis": "\"47 Prefecture Dogs\" is a short flash animation from a voice over variety TV program in Japan called \"SAY! YOU! SAY! ME!\" The animation takes Japan's 47 prefectures\u2014or more specifically, the local delicacies or famous landmarks from each of the regions\u2014and gives them a canine makeover. For example, the \"Fukuoka-ken\" (Fukuoka dog),\u2014Fukuoka of course being home to asianbeat HQ\u2014uses the delicacy \"mentaiko\" (spicy pollack roe) as the motif for its canine characterization.\n\nEach of the characters are played by voice actors that hail from each of the individual prefectures, \"Fukuoka-ken\" being voiced by Fukuoka's Kana Asumi.\n\nAnother feature of this anime is the use of regional dialect. All the dogs speak in the dialect of their individual prefectures. So for the Fukuoka dog you hear a lot of \"~to\" and \"~to yo\" at the end of sentences; for the Aichi dog it's \"~dagane,\" and for Ehime, \"~zonamoshi,\" etc.\n\n(Source: AsianBeat.com, edited)",
