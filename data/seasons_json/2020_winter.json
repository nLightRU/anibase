    "synopsis": "After their triumphant victory over Shiratorizawa Academy, the Karasuno High School volleyball team has earned their long-awaited ticket to nationals. As preparations begin, genius setter Tobio Kageyama is invited to the All-Japan Youth Training Camp to play alongside fellow nationally recognized players. Meanwhile, Kei Tsukishima is invited to a special rookie training camp for first-years within the Miyagi Prefecture. Not receiving any invitations himself, the enthusiastic Shouyou Hinata feels left behind.\n\nHowever, Hinata does not back down. Transforming his frustration into self-motivation, he boldly decides to sneak himself into the same rookie training camp as Tsukishima. Even though Hinata only lands himself a job as the ball boy, he comes to see this as a golden opportunity. He begins to not only reflect on his skills as a volleyball player but also analyze the plethora of information available on the court and how he can apply it.\n\nAs the much-anticipated national tournament approaches, the members of Karasuno's volleyball team attempt to overcome their weak points and refine their skills, all while aiming for the top!\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

    "synopsis": "The famous \"Seven Wonders\" that every school seems to have are a staple of Japanese urban legends. One of the most well-known of these tales is that of Hanako-san: the ghost of a young girl who haunts the school's bathrooms.\n\nKamome Academy has its own version of Hanako-san's legend. Rumors claim that if one successfully manages to summon Hanako-san, she will grant her summoner any wish. Lured by the gossip, many people have tried to call upon her, yet every attempt has failed. However, when Nene Yashiro, a girl hoping for romantic fortune, dares to summon Hanako-san, she discovers that the rumored \"girl\" is actually a boy!\n\nAfter a series of unfortunate events involving Nene's romantic desires, she is unwillingly entangled in the world of the supernatural, becoming Hanako-kun's assistant. Soon, she finds out about Hanako-kun's lesser-known duty: maintaining the fragile balance between mortals and apparitions.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

However, as soon as he opens the application, a green snake suddenly pops out from his phone screen and bites his neck, leaving him unconscious. Waking up in the infirmary without any signs of a snake bite, he is told by the school to take the rest of the day off. Although he is puzzled by what has happened, he dismisses the surreal experience as a hallucination and boards the train home.\n\nUnfortunately, his curiosity gets the better of him and he uses the application once again. As the application appears to be just like any other battle game, Kaname breathes out a sigh of relief and decides to start his first match. However, the pleasant surprise is short-lived, as his in-game opponent unexpectedly appears right in front of him and attempts to hunt him down with a knife.\n\nAs he desperately runs for his life, Kaname puts two and two together and realizes that Darwin's Game is not an ordinary game, but rather, it's a brutal fight for survival.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

A realm separated from law and ethics, it is a testing ground to the magic users who dominate it. As a race occupying the highest rungs of their society, the magic users think of the denizens of Hole as no more than insects. Murdered, mutilated, and made experiments without a second thought, the powerless Hole dwellers litter the halls of Hole's hospital on a daily basis.\n\nPossessing free access to and from the cesspool, and with little challenge to their authority, the magic users appear indomitable to most\u2014aside for a few. Kaiman, more reptile than man, is one such individual. He hunts them on a heedless quest for answers with only a trusted pair of bayonets and his immunity to magic. Cursed by his appearance and tormented by nightmares, magic users are his only clue to restoring his life to normal. With his biggest obstacle being his stomach, his female companion Nikaidou, who runs the restaurant Hungry Bug, is his greatest ally.\n\nSet in a gritty world of hellish design, Dorohedoro manages a healthy blend of comedy and lightheartedness with death and carnage. Taking plenty of twists and turns while following the lives of Hole's residents, it weaves a unique world of unearthly origin and dreary appearance not for the squeamish or easily disturbed.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

    "synopsis": "After an enthusiastic invitation from her friend, Kaede Honjou reluctantly agrees to try New World Online: a very popular VRMMO played by thousands of people across Japan. Naming her in-game character Maple, she sets out on her journey. As a complete novice to such games, she allocates all of her stat points into vitality, desiring to not get hurt. With not a single point in any other stat, Maple has extraordinarily high defense, but she can't move quickly or hit hard.\n\nThis does not end badly for her, however. Due to her high defense, Maple acquires overpowered skills such as Total Defense, Poison Immunity, and Devour. These skills, along with the incredibly powerful items she obtains, allow her to obliterate most enemies in a single hit. After only a few days of playing the game, Maple claims third place in a server-wide event, gaining a reputation as a player who is both unkillable and absurdly powerful.\n\nDespite her overpowered character, Kaede has much to learn. As she progresses through the game, she meets new friends and acquaintances, helping her complete new levels and events. Through all of her adventures, she may even pick up some other crazy skills that exceed all expectations.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Ever since she agreed to become their \"God of Wisdom,\" Kotoko Iwanaga has served as a mediator between the two realms, resolving any supernatural problems that come her way.\n\nAt a local hospital, Kotoko approaches Kurou Sakuragawa, a university student whose long-term relationship ended with an unfortunate breakup. Kotoko harbors feelings for him and suspects that something supernatural lurks within his harmless appearance, so she asks Kurou for his assistance in helping out youkai.\n\nTwo years later, news of an idol who was accidentally crushed to death by steel beams flooded the press. However, months later, sightings begin to tell of a faceless woman who wields a steel beam. As is the case for any supernatural problem, Kotoko and her partner set out to stop this spirit from wreaking havoc\u2014but this case may prove to be far more sinister and personal than they could have ever thought.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

    "synopsis": "Alcia is a world governed by \"Count\": numbers engraved on a person's body, representing any number related to their life. These Counts determine a person's social status and power in Alcia. If a Count reaches zero, the person is sent to the Abyss, a place rumored to be worse than death.\n\nHina, a traveler whose Count is based on the distance she traveled, witnessed her mother get dragged down into the Abyss. Determined to fulfill her mother's last wishes, she sets off on a journey in search of the legendary Aces\u2014heroes of the war that happened three hundred years ago, bearing a white star next to their Count.\n\nWhile wandering around, Hina encounters Licht Bach, a mysterious masked man with negative Count, and Nana, the owner of a tavern. In the midst of having a good time, Hina is tricked into a battle with a military soldier. However, despite his negative count, Licht rescues Hina and reveals that he has another count, one with a white star, one of a legendary Ace.\n\nPlunderer follows the journey of Hina and other inhabitants of Alcia as they discover the truth about their world, the Abyss, and the legendary Aces.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

    "synopsis": "The Mizuhanome System is a highly advanced development that allows people to enter one of the most intriguing places in existence\u2014the human mind. Through the use of so-called \"cognition particles\" left behind at a crime scene by the perpetrator, detectives from the specialized police squad Kura can manifest a criminal's unconscious mind as a bizarre stream of thoughts in a virtual world. Their task is to explore this psychological plane, called an \"id well,\" to reveal the identity of the culprit.\n\nNot just anyone can enter the id wells; the prerequisite is that you must have killed someone yourself. Such is the case for former detective Akihito Narihisago, who is known as \"Sakaido\" inside the id wells. Once a respected member of the police, tragedy struck, and he soon found himself on the other side of the law.\n\nNevertheless, Narihisago continues to assist Kura in confinement. While his prodigious detective skills still prove useful toward investigations, Narihisago discovers that not everything is as it seems, as behind the seemingly standalone series of murder cases lurks a much more sinister truth.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

    "synopsis": "It is widely believed that science can provide rational explanations for the countless phenomena of our universe. However, there are many aspects of our existence that science has not yet found a solution to and cannot decipher with numbers. The most notorious of these is the concept of love. While it may seem impossible to apply scientific theory to such an intricate and complex emotion, a daring pair of quick-witted Saitama University scientists aim to take on the challenge.\n\nOne day the bold and beautiful Ayame Himuro outwardly declares that she is in love with Shinya Yukimura, her fellow logical and level-headed scientist. Acknowledging his own lack of experience with romance, Yukimura questions what factors constitute love in the first place and whether he is in love with Himuro or not. Both clueless in the dealings of love, the pair begin to conduct detailed experiments on one another to test the human characteristics that indicate love and discern whether they demonstrate these traits toward each other.\n\nAs Himuro and Yukimura begin their intimate analysis, can the two scientists successfully apply scientific theory, with the help of their friends, to quantify the feelings they express for one another?\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

    "synopsis": "Midori Asakusa sees the world a bit differently. Always having her nose in a sketchbook, Asakusa draws detailed landscapes and backgrounds of both the world around her and the one within her boundless imagination. Even the simple act of doodling on a wall evolves into an emergency repair on the outer hull of her spaceship. She is only brought back to reality by her best friend Sayaka Kanamori. The pair are stark opposites, with Asakusa's childlike wonder contrasted by Kanamori's calculated approach to life. \n\nAfter a chance encounter where the two \"save\" the young model Tsubame Misuzaki from her overprotective bodyguard, a connection instantly sparks between Asakusa and Misuzaki, as both share an intense passion for art and animation. Whereas Asakusa is interested in backgrounds and settings, Misuzaki loves drawing the human form. Sensing a money-making opportunity, Kanamori suggests that they start an animation club, which they disguise as a motion picture club since the school already has an anime club. Thus begins the trio's journey of producing animation that will awe the world. \n\nFrom the brilliant mind of Masaaki Yuasa, Eizouken ni wa Te wo Dasu na! is a love letter to animation, wildly creative in its approach, and a testament to the potential of the medium.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Quick to anger, the human race engaged in a war that all but wiped them out. The few humans that remain are seen as a delicacy, serving no purpose but to be hunted down and eaten.\n\nOne day, Golem, a wandering protector of nature, encounters a lone human child while patrolling. Inspired by her enthusiasm, he takes the girl, named Somali, under his wing. Together, the duo embarks on a journey to find Somali's parents and bring her home.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

    "synopsis": "Seton Academy is a place attended by a plethora of interesting and diverse animal species. Jin Mazama is one of the few humans there, who also happens to vehemently hate animals from the bottom of his heart! One day, he stumbles upon the rowdy and assertive girl Ranka Ookami, a small \"lone wolf\" without a pack, who has not a single friend.\n\nThe desperate Ranka tries to invite Jin into joining her pack; Jin, who hates animals, naturally refuses. Amid this situation, Jin meets Hitomi Hino, a fellow human, and promptly becomes infatuated with her. After getting to know each other, the two decide to create a cooking club, and after a few bad-blooded misunderstandings, Ranka soon joins the club as well.\n\nThus begins the howl-some and howl-arious story of two normal humans; an adorable wolf; a cheerful koala; a sluggish, blonde sloth; and a feline with cattitude in their newfound club\u2014in a story that teaches that friendship can be forged by creatures of different kinds.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

    "synopsis": "Rumor has it that if a young girl strikes a bargain with a white fairy, it will grant any wish her heart desires. However, in exchange, she will become a magical girl and must put her life on the line to slay fearsome and ferocious witches.\n\nIroha Tamaki, a kind-hearted middle schooler from Takarazaki City, is living proof that these rumors are true. Armed with a magical crossbow and the ability to heal injuries, Iroha seeks out the labyrinths where witches hide and defeats them before they can prey on humans. Yet Iroha has no memory of her wish, and even Kyuubey, the white fairy himself, seems to have no idea what Iroha requested of him.\n\nOne day, Iroha hears rumors of a city where \"magical girls can be saved,\" and finds herself on a sunset train to Kamihama City. Unfortunately, she discovers that the witches in Kamihama are far more powerful than usual. After veteran magical girl Yachiyo Nanami is forced to save her, Iroha vows to never return. But when a chance encounter with a tiny Kyuubey seems to trigger distant memories, Iroha is compelled to investigate the mysterious city despite the danger.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

But an experiment gone horribly wrong warps Azalie's appearance, trapping her in the form of a dragon.\n\nElders at the Tower\u2014more interested in preserving their reputation rather than their students' lives\u2014drive off the transformed Azalie and cover up the incident. Outraged, Krylancelo strikes out on his own, taking the new name of \"Orphen\" and vowing to return Azalie to her normal state.\n\nFive years later, Orphen's quest has stalled. A chance encounter brings him face to face with Azalie again, but he still has no way to restore her body. And with a hostile group of sorcerers hunting her down, he may be running out of time. The past and present collide as Orphen tries to find how to save Azalie from their former teachers and friends.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

    "synopsis": "Natsuza Yuzuki has been playing rugby as a left-winger ever since he was a child. After enrolling in Doushisha University, he quickly becomes a rising star in the Kansai University League.\n\nHis dreams are shattered, however, when a nasty motorbike accident leaves him with a spinal hernia\u2014making him unable to be able to play rugby ever again. With no role available other than the position of manager, he accepts his new post and hopes his squad can obtain a league title.\n\nYuzuki's team is an unlikely group, including his stoic best friend and full-back Seiichirou Jingyouji; hot-headed first-year Yasunari Tsuru, who harbors a strong dislike for Natsuza, filling his senior's old position as left wing; and Yuu Mashiro, who is struggling to hold his ground as a scrum half.\n\nDespite Natsuza putting his all into training his team for a league title, their squad still feels incomplete. A year ago, Ibuki Ueka, the genius fly-half that was once Doushisha's ace, suddenly quit rugby\u2014and now Natsuza is determined to get him back.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Alongside the knight was Gest\u00f6ber, who accompanied him through countless battles. In the present day, destiny causes them to reincarnate as Kabuto Hanadori and Seri Koyuki, two classmates.\n\nTheir reunion should be a joyous moment, if not for the fact that these fantasied heroes are just products of Kabuto's delusions. As the fictional \"Gest\u00f6ber,\" Seri finds himself in various embarrassing situations due to Kabuto's antics that sometimes grow out of his control. Moreover, his classmate Utsugi Tsukimiya joins the fray with his absurdly accurate mind-reading abilities, slowly destroying Seri's social life.\n\nSeri tries hard to stay away from them, refusing to acknowledge their shenanigans, however with Kabuto's chuunibyou and Utsugi's unpredictability, he is only bound to be swept by the craziness coming his way.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Reserved and timid, Miu struggles to converse with or even smile at customers when at her part time job, but she works tirelessly to support her mother and precious little sister, Haru. It is a shock when a letter arrives from the entertainment company GIP, announcing that she has been chosen as a candidate for their new project. \n\nMiu decides to accept the invitation and heads to the meeting spot where the eccentric ensemble of other candidates filter in, all summoned by their own letters. Not long after, the girls are escorted by a manager to a luxurious secret facility, where it is explained that they must follow the mysterious directions of \"The Wall,\" whose orders are absolute. \n\nThe 24th of December, 2016, will see the birth of idols like no other; on that day, the group 22/7 will debut, whether or not Miu and the other members are ready to take the stage.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

    "synopsis": "It has been half a century since humans took to the sky to hunt dragons. Although dragons present a great danger, every part of them is extremely valuable, and brave dragon hunters, called \"drakers,\" risk their lives aboard special dragon-hunting airships to pursue them.\n\nHowever, despite the thrill and excitement of hunting, the life of a draker is not easy. Ostracized by society, the drakers have no place to call home. Life in the air is not any easier either: maintaining an airship is dull and expensive\u2014and dragons are even harder to catch, as each one is unique. \n\nOne of the last remaining such airships is the Quin Zaza. Its courageous crew includes Takita, an eager newcomer trying to earn her place on the ship; Mika, a reckless but highly skilled hunter; and Jirou, an earnest young man chasing both the dragons and his past. United by the same goal, these hunters face arduous aerial battles that involve daring feats of skill, strategy, and more than their fair share of danger.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

They fell into the hands of people who were not supposed to know of their existence, causing misfortune to those who abused their power. The Hoshisato family of magicians has special access to the Artifacts, and they take it upon themselves to return them to their rightful place.\n\nDespite her inexperience, Kana \"Hatena\" Hoshisato wishes to aid her parents Mamoru and Maeve in their quest, doing her best to improve. Meanwhile, her childhood friend Makoto Shiranui has come to their mansion to study magic under her father's tutelage as part of a promise they made years ago. Hatena is excited to see her friend again, only to be utterly disappointed when the person she thought to be a girl all these years turns out to be a boy, leading to a bitter reunion.\n\nBefore long, Makoto comes to know of the Artifacts and the true identities of the magicians he admires. Unfazed, he continues to strive to fulfill his promises and stay true to why he learns magic\u2014to ease the sadness of people around him and, most importantly, to become a person worthy of being Hatena's partner.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

After receiving a mysterious letter, Izumi Tachibana arrives at the venue where her father directed a once-popular theater group, Mankai Company, but learns that the building is about to be repurposed due to excessive debt. At the last minute, she convinces the debt collector to give the ensemble one more chance. He is willing to accept but on three conditions: their debut show must be successfully produced by the following month, the four all-male sub-troupes must be reinstated, and the debt must be paid off within a year. To top it off, Izumi herself must become the director.\n\nWith no time to lose, Izumi quickly gathers five people for the Spring Troupe: Sakuya Sakuma, an enthusiastic high school student; Masumi Usui, a boy infatuated with Izumi; Tsuzuru Minagi, an aspiring playwright; Itaru Chigasaki, a mature office worker; and Citron, a friendly foreigner. Though they have little or no experience in acting, it's up to Izumi to train and prepare them for a performance that will restore Mankai Company to its former glory.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

    "synopsis": "Sickly but optimistic middle school student Nodoka Hanadera has just moved to Sukoyaka City, a place famous for its healthy atmosphere. She immediately befriends two of her classmates: the gentle but athletic Chiyu Sawaizumi, whose family runs a hot spring inn, and the bubbly and fashionable daughter of a vet, Hinata Hiramitsu.\n\nSoon after arriving, Nodoka finds an ill puppy in a forest, surrounded by three magical talking animals: Rabbirin, Penguitan, and Nyatoran. They tell her that the puppy, Princess Latte, can only be cured by defeating a nearby monster known as a \"Mega Byogen\" and purifying the land it has corrupted. Despite being powerless, Nodoka refuses to give up and let Latte suffer. \n\nMoved by her determination, Rabbirin forms a pact with Nodoka, allowing her to transform into a hero known as a Precure. Assuming the persona of  \"Cure Grace,\" the energized Nodoka fights off the Byogen and heals the earth, curing Latte.\n\nAs the Byogen and their leaders continue their attacks, Penguitan and Nyatoran also find their partners in Chiyu and Hinata, giving them the powers of \"Cure Fontaine\" and \"Cure Sparkle\" respectively. Now, it's up to the three Precure and their animal friends to stop the Byogen and protect the earth from their infections!\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
