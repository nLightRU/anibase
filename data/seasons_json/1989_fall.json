She aspires to an average lifestyle as a delicate young lady with a handsome boyfriend in the near future.\n\nUnfortunately for Yawara, she has an undesirable prodigious talent in Judo, a modern martial art that is neither feminine nor fashionable. Moreover, Yawara is the only granddaughter of the seventh dan Judo master Jigorou Inokuma, who expects her to become a Japanese Judoka superstar of the '90s.\n\nYawara cautiously hides her strength from everyone to maintain a normal reputation but is often pushed to situations when she must exercise her Judo skills. Observing Yawara's immense potential from the shadows, Kousaku Matsuda, a sports reporter from a substandard paper, is willing to do everything he can to bring her into the limelight.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

The story began and ended with no special beginning or endings, but it is arranged chronologically (in the sense that it follows seasonal changes).\n\n(Source: ANN)",
