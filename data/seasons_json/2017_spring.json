    "synopsis": "For centuries, humanity has been hunted by giant, mysterious predators known as the Titans. Three mighty walls\u2014Wall Maria, Rose, and Sheena\u2014provided peace and protection for humanity for over a hundred years. That peace, however, was shattered when the Colossal Titan and Armored Titan appeared and destroyed the outermost wall, Wall Maria. Forced to retreat behind Wall Rose, humanity waited with bated breath for the Titans to reappear and destroy their safe haven once more.\n\nIn Shingeki no Kyojin Season 2, Eren Yeager and others of the 104th Training Corps have just begun to become full members of the Survey Corps. As they ready themselves to face the Titans once again, their preparations are interrupted by the invasion of Wall Rose\u2014but all is not as it seems as more mysteries are unraveled. As the Survey Corps races to save the wall, they uncover more about the invading Titans and the dark secrets of their own members.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

    "synopsis": "Following the successful end of the Fourth Shinobi World War, Konohagakure has been enjoying a period of peace, prosperity, and extraordinary technological advancement. This is all due to the efforts of the Allied Shinobi Forces and the village's Seventh Hokage, Naruto Uzumaki. Now resembling a modern metropolis, Konohagakure has changed, particularly the life of a shinobi. Under the watchful eye of Naruto and his old comrades, a new generation of shinobi has stepped up to learn the ways of the ninja.\n\nBoruto Uzumaki is often the center of attention as the son of the Seventh Hokage. Despite having inherited Naruto's boisterous and stubborn demeanor, Boruto is considered a prodigy and is able to unleash his potential with the help of supportive friends and family. Unfortunately, this has only worsened his arrogance and his desire to surpass Naruto which, along with his father's busy lifestyle, has strained their relationship. However, a sinister force brewing within the village may threaten Boruto's carefree life.\n\nNew friends and familiar faces join Boruto as a new story begins.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

But the sudden death of their parents tears their new family apart, resulting in Sagiri becoming a shut-in which cut her off from her brother and society.\n\nWhile caring for what's left of his family, Masamune earns a living as a published light novel author with one small problem: he's never actually met his acclaimed illustrator, Eromanga-sensei, infamous for drawing the most lewd erotica. Through an embarrassing chain of events, he learns that his very own little sister was his partner the whole time!\n\nAs new characters and challenges appear, Masamune and Sagiri must now face the light novel industry together. Eromanga-Sensei follows the development of their relationship and their struggle to become successful; and as Sagiri slowly grows out of her shell, just how long will she be able to hide her true persona from the rest of the world?\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

    "synopsis": "Humans have designed countless worlds\u2014each one born from the unique imagination of its creator. Souta Mizushino is a high school student who aspires to be such a creator by writing and illustrating his own light novel. One day, while watching anime for inspiration, he is briefly transported into a fierce fight scene. When he returns to the real world, he realizes something is amiss: the anime's headstrong heroine, Selesia Yupitilia, has somehow returned with him.\n\nBefore long, other fictional characters appear in the world, carrying the hopes and scars of their home. A princely knight, a magical girl, a ruthless brawler, and many others now crowd the streets of Japan. However, the most mysterious one is a woman in full military regalia, dubbed \"Gunpuku no Himegimi,\" who knows far more than she should about the creators' world. Despite this, no one knows her true name or the world she is from.\n\nMeanwhile, Souta and Selesia work together with Meteora \u00d6sterreich, a calm and composed librarian NPC, to uncover the meaning behind these unnatural events. With powerful forces at play, the once clear line between reality and imagination continues to blur, leading to a fateful meeting between creators and those they created.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

It is during his icy slumber that terrifying creatures known as \"Beasts\" emerge on the Earth's surface and threaten humanity's existence. Willem awakens 500 years later, only to find himself the sole survivor of his race as mankind is wiped out.\n \nTogether with the other surviving races, Willem takes refuge on the floating islands in the sky, living in fear of the Beasts below. He lives a life of loneliness and only does odd jobs to get by. One day, he is tasked with being a weapon storehouse caretaker. Thinking nothing of it, Willem accepts, but he soon realizes that these weapons are actually a group of young Leprechauns. Though they bear every resemblance to humans, they have no regard for their own lives, identifying themselves as mere weapons of war. Among them is Chtholly Nota Seniorious, who is more than willing to sacrifice herself if it means defeating the Beasts and ensuring peace.\n \nWillem becomes something of a father figure for the young Leprechauns, watching over them fondly and supporting them in any way he can. He, who once fought so bravely on the frontlines, can now only hope that the ones being sent to battle return safely from the monsters that destroyed his kind.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

When that was enforced, a five-member vigilante corps-like organization called the \"Supreme Five Swords\" was also formed.\n\nAfter many generations, the five swords eventually became a group which corrected problematic students, and the academy started proactively accepting such students in order to correct them.\n\nNomura Fudou was sent to this school after being part of a huge brawl. What will he do when the only options he has after enrolling are being expelled from that school or being corrected the way the rest of the male students there were...by being forced to dress and act like a girl!\n\n(Source: Batoto, edited)",

    "synopsis": "When a strange girl named Guri comes knocking at Seiji Aino's door, he quickly finds himself thrust into a world of romantic troubles. Claiming that she will die if he doesn't kiss someone within 24 hours, Guri's pleas of desperation are misunderstood as pleas for love, leading Seiji to kiss the cute stranger that came barging into his house. In actuality, it turns out that this cosplaying cupid is the wielder of a Kiss Note, in which any pairing of names she writes will kiss and become a couple. Guri explains that she misspelt and accidentally wrote Seiji's name while indulging in her yaoi fantasies, but because she had yet to pair him with anyone, their kiss was meaningless. Even worse, Guri reveals that if Seiji is not coupled with anyone soon, not only will she die, but Seiji will remain a virgin for eternity!\n\nEager to escape his fate, Seiji sets his sights on the beautiful and popular Akane Hiyama. But after Akane hears that he kissed Guri, she reveals the obsessive and psychopathic feelings that she holds for the unfortunate boy and proceeds to viciously attack them. In the ensuing confusion, Guri is able to pair Seiji with Akane in the Kiss Note, temporarily saving Seiji from any further bodily harm. But to complicate matters, Guri's newfound feelings lead her to also pair the two of them with herself. Just when the situation could not get any more convoluted, this new coupling with Guri has turned Seiji and Akane into temporary angels, forcing them into assisting the cupid with her work of pairing humans, lest they be cast into hell. With all semblance of normality snatched from his life, Seiji gets to work at matchmaking with these eccentric girls by his side.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

For one, Megumi Katou still has an incredibly flat personality and is unable to fit the role of Tomoya's ideal heroine. The other members of Blessing Software, Eriri Spencer Sawamura, Utaha Kasumigaoka, and Michiru Hyoudou, often forget she is even there due to her lack of presence and character. \n\nThroughout the development of their game, Blessing Software learns the struggles of working in an industry where deadlines must be met and edits are made constantly, and the hardships of working in a group setting.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Their physical prowess and bestial nature cause them to be feared and shunned by both humans and witches.

He travels with Zero and Albus, a young magician, on their search for the Grimoire of Zero: a powerful spell book that could be extremely dangerous in the wrong hands.

Their progress is largely due to the administration of the newly appointed king, Charioce XVII, who has stolen a power from the gods and allowed for the abuse and slavery of the demon race in the capital. As humans continue to immorally exploit demons, a sense of hostility against humans begins to build up within demon communities, threatening a revolt. Meanwhile, an atmosphere of uneasiness is spreading among the gods, as they scramble to regain their lost power.\n\nAmidst it all, Nina Drango, a cheerful young bounty hunter, has arrived at the Royal Capital with hopes of settling down and earning a living. However, her peaceful life in the capital is quickly thrown into chaos when she crosses paths with the ominous Rag Demon who is determined to seek revenge against humans, and Kaisar Lidfard, a noble knight battling an internal moral conflict.\n\nShingeki no Bahamut: Virgin Soul continues the tale of the social and moral conflict between humans, gods, and demons, and their struggle for survival and dominance.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

    "synopsis": "In Japanese folklore, a \"tsukumogami\" is an object that has gained a soul, becoming alive and self-aware. There are two types of tsukumogami: the mature \"tsugumomo,\" who have developed through long years of harmony with their owners, and the aberrant \"amasogi,\" premature spirits that are only born to grant the destructive wishes of certain people.\n\nKazuya Kagami has never gone without his mother's obi after her death. Be it at home or school, he keeps it safe with him at all times. One day, he nearly loses his life when a wig amasogi attacks him. When all seems to be over, his treasured obi defends him, transforming into a beautiful girl. She introduces herself as Kiriha, a tsugumomo owned by Kazuya's mother. \n\nWith Kiriha's arrival, Kazuya enters a reality he has never seen before, a world with gods and tsukumogami.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

He could always manage to protect himself when he was alone, but now he has the added challenge of protecting former Commander Casca, a shell of her former self who neither remembers nor trusts him. They never have a moment's rest with the constant threat of demons, and they need a place where Casca will be safe till they find a way to heal her. Their elf ally, Puck, tells of the mystical land of Elfhelm, which is supposed to be a safe haven from the demons that ravage the lands. Tired and with only a vague hope, they struggle on to find a place to live\u2014and they still need to find those responsible for the madness they are forced to endure. \n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

    "synopsis": "Lucifer, an Archangel and former head of the Seven Heavenly Virtues, is banished from Heaven after revolting against the Lord's will.. While plummeting from the skies, she is halted halfway between Heaven and Hell after crashing through the roof of a high school church. Though she is witnessed by Maria Totsuka, a soft-spoken student at the academy, Lucifer swiftly continues her descent into the depths of Hell.\n\nSoon after her arrival, Lucifer is found by aspiring Demon Lord and fangirl Leviathan. The two decide to overthrow the Seven Sins, the authorities of Hell under the leadership of Belial. But with their combined powers, the Seven Sins are able to repel Lucifer and contain her divine powers by placing a Garb of Punishment over her body, transforming Lucifer into a Demon Lord. \n\nLonging for revenge and accompanied by Leviathan, Lucifer makes her way back to Earth, where she forces Maria to become her immortal slave. Together with her new accomplices, Lucifer sets out on a mission to subdue the Seven Sins so she may be free of the curse brought upon by her Garb.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

After a fruitless job hunt, she finally receives a part-time offer as queen of the bizarre \"Kingdom of Chupakabura,\" a rundown mini-attraction in the small agricultural town of Manoyama.

Determined to bring excitement to the dying town with the help of local residents, the queen enacts a series of projects to highlight the beauty and charm of Manoyama's culture.\n\nSakura Quest delves into the story of a tight-knit community that is struggling to balance change while also maintaining the rich traditions and bonds which define their identity.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Thus, the king of Grannzreich has called upon Heine to undertake a daunting task that has driven away many before him\u2014become the new royal tutor to four princes who are in line for the throne.\n\nThe four heirs each have very distinct and troublesome personalities: Licht, the flirtatious youngest prince; his immature older brother Leonhard; Bruno the studious third prince; and Kai, the oldest of the four and the most reserved. Hilarity ensues as Heine attempts to connect with each of the princes in order to groom them for the throne. However, Heine's mysterious past and dark undercurrents in the present may threaten the harmony within the kingdom.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

    "synopsis": "Cool-headed and rational, Koujirou Shindou is a government official and master negotiator with a well-earned reputation. While departing on a business trip, a giant cube materializes and his plane is taken undamaged into the mysterious, indestructible structure.\n\nAs Japanese authorities attempt to identify the cube's properties and origins, Shindou encounters an otherworldly entity known as Yaha-kui zaShunina, who materializes in the form of a human man. He assures Shindou that the passengers are not in any danger and requests help in negotiations with the human world.\n\nHailing from a higher dimensional universe known as Novo, Yaha-kui zaShunina is able to transfer information between Novo and Shindou's universe through a cube called Kado. Despite having these unfathomable abilities, he does not appear hostile. Instead, he announces that he has come to this world with only one intention: to \"advance\" humanity\u2014starting with Japan.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

To overcome this, Hina hopes to get involved in theater, inspired by a play she saw during her school's field trip. So, Hina moves into the Hitotose Manor in the bustling city of Tokyo to study at Fujiyama High School, aspiring to join the school's renowned theater club.\n\nBut to Hina's dismay, she learns that Fujiyama High's theater club has been on a lengthy hiatus. Having already come to Tokyo and enrolled in the school, Hina is at a loss for what to do next. Sensing her disappointment and eagerness to learn theater, Chiaki Hagino, the landlady of Hitotose Manor, encourages Hina to create a troupe with the residents of Hitotose Manor as its members.\n\nHinako Note follows Hina as she begins a new life in Tokyo attending Fujiyama High while learning the ropes of theater with the support of her friends along the way.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

    "synopsis": "After uncovering the truth behind their father's untimely death, life for the four Shimogamo brothers returns to relative peace with each trying to live up to their father's greatness in their own way. For the eldest, Yaichirou, who aims to become the next Trick Magister and leader of the tanuki society, it starts with reinstating the popular shogi tournament. For Yajirou, it is restoring his former shapeshifting abilities, whilst little Yashirou is content with continuing his work at the family\u2019s factory. But for the third son, Yasaburou, it simply means embracing the \"fool's blood\" he inherited from his father and living a carefree but interesting life. This, of course, includes hunting for the mysterious and elusive snake-like creature known as a tsuchinoko, and causing ripples of trouble at every turn.\n\nHowever, these ripples threaten to turn into waves with the return of Nidaime, the estranged son of the brothers' tengu teacher, Professor Akadama. Nidaime bears a grudge against not only his father, but his father's apprentice Benten as well. His loyalties suddenly brought into question, Yasaburou must use his tanuki wit to appease all sides without getting caught in the crossfire, before the delicate balance between human, tengu, and tanuki is overthrown and all hell breaks loose.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

By using this cyberspace, duelists can now create their own avatars and duel their way to glory within a virtual reality.\n\nHowever, much like the real world, the digital world is not free from war, conflict, and mysteries. Years ago, a hacker organization known as the Knights of Hanoi unleashed an attack on Link Vrains. Led by the anonymous Revolver, their aim was to annihilate the artificial intelligence program known as the Cyberse. After a failed attempt, one of their targets, Ignis, managed to escape and hide the Cyberse somewhere in the network.\n\nFive years later, high school student Yuusaku Fujiki encounters a strange artificial intelligence program while dueling in Link Vrains. Under the guise of his avatar named Playmaker, Yuusaku and his partner in crime, Shouichi Kusanagi, decide to join forces with the peculiar existence. As he seeks the truth behind a mysterious incident of the past, Yuusaku battles against the Knights of Hanoi and SOL Technologies in a race that might alter the fate of the world.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Inside she finds Gourai, a tiny humanoid robot capable of movement and combat known as a Frame Arms Girl. Gourai is the first of her kind, possessing an extremely advanced AI that allows her to form a personality, learn, and grow, much like the human mind.\n\nFollowing Gourai's activation, Ao is thrust headfirst into the world of Frame Arms Girls as more and more of the intelligent robots are delivered straight to her front door. With a rather hefty cash incentive pushing her forward, Ao is committed to collecting as much data about the Frame Arms Girls and their combat as possible, all while they learn what it means to be human.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

These inexplicable stories are chronicled throughout the pages of a certain strange encyclopedia, sheltered within a crumbling, decrepit building. Do you dare to open its cover and experience the horrors firsthand?\n\nEach of the macabre tales held within the book's pages details some unusual, surreal experiences that often come to a gruesome end. A man searches for his adulterous wife, only to find himself at the mercy of otherworldly visitors; a boy befriends a snowman who harbors a sinister secret; crop circles suddenly form on a family farm, created by some unexpected visitors; hidden in plain sight, menacing mechanical beings continue on undetected. In all of these horrifying stories, nothing is as simple as it seems, revealing a terrifying darkness that perhaps might have been best left alone.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Such is the situation of members of the Excavate Company, a reckless band of I-Machine miners led by the notorious Grayman that aims to gather orichalt for profit.  \n\nDuring a mining incursion, the group rescues Maya Mikuri, a student who was abandoned by her crew. Accused of stealing classified information on orichalt by her former colleagues, she joins the Excavate Company in hopes of clearing her name. They then begin an adventure that will change their lives\u2014including that of Ido, an ace member of the group with no memory of his past. For the first time, Ido might have the chance to rediscover his true identity.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

    "synopsis": "Kurogu had a love of kabuki theater instilled in him from a very young age thanks to his grandfather. Now, as a high school student, he desires to create his own kabuki club in order to bring an appreciation of kabuki to a wider audience. He'll find, though, that with the weight of hundreds of years of strict tradition, it's not so easy to get high schoolers interested. A rough start is not enough to deter Kurogu, and he'll work hard to inspire in others the same burning passion he feels, until the day he can put on his own performance!\n\n(Source: Honey's Anime)",

    "synopsis": "A new school year has begun at Ayanagi Academy for Yuuta Hoshitani and the members of Team Ootori. As the school's annual graduation performance titled \"Shadow and Lights\" quickly approaches, the second-years in the Musical Department must participate in the production as part of their curriculum. Out of the 25 students in the division, five of them will receive a training role and actively participate as actors in the program alongside the graduating class. Attaining one of these coveted spots will not only increase a student's academic standing within the department, but it will also put them in the running for a position on the elite Kao Council.\n\nWhile every student in the department strives to obtain one of the five training roles, Team Yuzuriha's Riku Ageha is practically a front-runner for the role of Alexis' Shadow. Having idolized an Ayanagi alumnus' performance of Alexis, Ageha has spent a majority of his life perfecting the portrayal in hopes of being selected for the show. In contrast, Hoshitani's lack of experience in show business puts him at a great disadvantage for any of the roles in the production. \n\nWith specialized training from the \"Ancients\"\u2014former Kao Council members and Ayanagi alumni\u2014the second-years give it their all as they aim for the stars and beyond.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Working alongside him are the aloof Pepu and the gaming-obsessed Chiku, though the value of their membership remains somewhat questionable. With his two henchmen by his side, the crew's inexperienced leader sets his sights on their first target: Earth.\n\nAccording to the manuals, Earth should be a simple enough target, but the situation spirals out of control right from the start. As it turns out, convincing over seven billion humans to simply roll over and accept their new overlord is no easy feat. Having been blown off by the entire human species, Don and his squadron touch down on Earth and begin their search for a way to subjugate humanity. However, with their unexpected failure, they face more pressing issues\u2014namely, finding food and paying rent\u2014so their plans for galactic domination will have to be put on hold for a little longer.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

The series shows Stitch kidnapped by space criminals who want to use him to have their own destructive genetic experiment. However, he escapes to China's Huangshan mountains, where he befriends Ai, a spirited local girl who is at risk of being separated from her older sister Jiejie. Stitch becomes Ai's \"dog\", and the two help one another dealing with the other's problems; Ai helps Stitch deal with the space criminals, while he helps her stay in the mountains with her family. Jumba and Pleakley later show up initially trying to bring Stitch back to the United Galactic Federation, but Ai and Jiejie convince the two aliens to let Stitch stay with them. Although Jumba and Pleakley also stay to keep a watch on Stitch and to help out him and his new family, Jumba gets concerned that a hidden function that he secretly programmed in Stitch\u2014a function that causes the experiment to grow into a giant beast when his destructive programming is triggered in a large city\u2014could be unleashed if the space criminals figure out how to subconsciously manipulate Stitch into triggering it.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)",

When he convinces his friends to enter what appears to be an abandoned warehouse, he stumbles across a trio of dusty, retired Athlons. \n\nTeam Athlon makes it to the Finals and exceeds everyone's expectations, crushing Baron Bach in the process. The Baron is unwilling to relinquish the title and accuses Ethan of cheating. Unfortunately for The Baron, Agent A-1 presents a mountain of evidence that proves Baron Bach is the culprit. A dramatic battle ensues, but Team Athlon emerges the victor, and as the new Off-Road Racing Champions! \n\n(Source: Tobot Wiki)",
