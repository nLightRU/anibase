    "synopsis": "Attacker You! is the story of ambitious and energetic 13-year-old junior high schoolgirl You Hazuki (variously known as \"Mila,\" \"Jeanne\" or \"Juana\" in Western dubbed versions of the anime), who moves to Tokyo from Osaka to live with her father Toshihiko, a cameraman recently returned from Peru, and attend school. You's mother is not in the picture, having left when You was very young. Also living with You and her father is her younger brother Sunny, who is very attached to his older sister and tends to follow her everywhere she goes, including to school and to her volleyball matches. You is also curious about Kyushi Tajima, the pretty blonde woman whom she sees covering volleyball games on television, and about why her father becomes very angry whenever You mentions her.\n\nYou is passionate about volleyball and dreams of one day being a part of Japan's national women's volleyball team in the 1988 Seoul Olympics. She joins her school's girls' volleyball team and quickly becomes one of the top players, although her coach (who is also her homeroom teacher) is brutal and literally slaps his players around when they don't live up to his expectations. You begins a tumultuous friendship with former school volleyball champ and former arch-rival Nami Hayase (French name: \"Peggy\"), which comes to a head when the two girls join opposing professional teams. She also develops a crush on So Takiki, the captain of the Hikawa boys' volleyball team (known as \"Shiro,\" \"Serge\" or \"Sergio\" in various Western versions), and puts as much effort into trying to win his heart as she does into her game.",

The existence of the island was removed from the official records, and Tagami Yuu made a journey to search for the reason.\n\nHe sailed for the island with Dr. Waive who was his father's friend, Doris who is the daughter of Dr. Waive, and Captain who is the friend of Dr. Waive. On their way to the island, GAIL, the international conglomerate, and gangster, Cougar Connection lead by Lady Lynx attacked them.\n\nThey managed to arrive at the island, but suddenly a mysterious monster began to attack them. When they became ready for death, a blue giant robot appeared. It destroyed the monster and saved them. Although it was an existence far beyond human knowledge, it reminded Yuu of something warm and familiar.\n\nIt was Giant Gorg which is called \"Messenger of the God\" by the inhabitants of the island. Escaping from the attack of GAIL's assault team, Gorg guided Yuu into the underworld. There, he found alien's relic and an alien who woke up after 30,000 years' sleep.\n\n(Source: AnimeNfo)",

    "synopsis": "In the ancient, legendary past, the peaceful kingdom of Mu is under siege by the war-like Dragonian Empire. With a woeful amount of fire power and only a giant statue of a deity to watch over them, the young Queen Aira and her people are no match for the Dorado, the Golden King,and his army of dinosaurs.\n\nBut Aira reaches out to someone who can save them, a warrior from another time and place. That person happens to be Yamato Hino, an average though highly athletic high school boy in modern-day Tokyo. At first Yamato think she\u2019s going crazy when he gets messages from a spectral young woman, but she eventually convinces him to take the plunge\u2026 through a mystical portal to ancient Mu.\n\nBefore the Tokyo teen can get acclimated, Dragonia attacks again, but this time, the dinosaurs and soldiers are repulsed by the giant God Mazinger, now merged with Yamato. Though Mu has achieved it's first victory, they have along way to go, as does Yamato, who will need to over come his own deep character flaws and become a true warrior to save the kingdom and get back home. \n\n(Source: Discotek)",
    "background": "God Mazinger is a manga, anime, and novel series by Go Nagai in 1984. Despite the title Mazinger being present, this spin-off series has no connection to previous series. Instead it is an original story about a young man who ends up in an alternate reality. While God Mazinger has no connection to the other Mazinger series, it is indeed part of the Mazinger franchise as besides the title and the same author as the other series it is featured in the Mazinger Bible along with other manga such Mazinger (USA) and MazinSaga. The anime version was originally going to feature 24 episodes and while material was drawn up the final epilogue episode was never shown. Part of the reason is because the air date was removed for the 1984 Olympics, and TMS for some reason decided to cut the epilogue from the show entirely. (Source: Mazinger Wikia)",
