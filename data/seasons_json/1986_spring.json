    "synopsis": "In the town of Clock Hill, there is an old boarding house called Maison Ikkoku. While the residence itself is fairly normal, most of its occupants are not. Yuusaku Godai, its most quiet tenant, has finally reached his limit with his neighbors' constant disruptions and boisterous partying. Wanting a calmer place to call home so that he can study in peace, he prepares to move away.\n\nHowever, his plans to leave are suddenly interrupted when he meets the new boarding house manager, Kyoko Otonashi. Falling madly in love with her, he decides that the boarding house may not be such a bad place to live after all. Unfortunately for him, Kyoko has her own romantic troubles: she is a widow whose husband died six months into their marriage. And despite her blossoming feelings for Godai, Kyoko still cherishes her dearly departed husband, and she believes that no other man could possibly fill the void in her heart. But with Godai's persistence and some help of the other eccentric tenants, she may experience true love once again.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

They tell Yumi that flower fairies give magic tools to children who take care of flowers. Kakimaru and Keshimaru, which sees Yumi's pure affection towards flowers, decide to give her a magic cane and a pendant. By using the cane, any pictures she drew in the air takes form and becomes real. However, once the pendant starts to flash, there are only 30 seconds left before the power of the magic disappears. Yumi always tries to use her magical power in a good manner, but she is hasty and goofy. As a result, her magic often causes a big trouble around her.  This is the fourth series of Magical Girl Series.\n\n(Source: Studio Pierrot)",
