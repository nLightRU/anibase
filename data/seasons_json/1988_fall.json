Akko always cherishes the palm-sized mirror that was given to her by her father and treats it with care. However, the mirror was accidentally broken by her absent-minded mother. On a night where a beautiful full-moon hangs in the sky, Akko-chan buries the mirror pieces in the garden and goes to sleep. She is awakened by a soft and kind voice which belongs to the Queen of the Mirror Kingdom. She sends her gratitiude to Akko-chan for cherishing the mirror with care and offers her a magical compact mirror. Whenever she sings the magical words, Akko-chan will be able to transform into anything she wants.\n\n(Source: ANN)",

    "synopsis": "Asunaro is a new student at a school with three baseball teams; the first is renowned as being one of the best in the prefecture, but the third, Asunaro\u2019s team, is filled with the rejects and unskilled of the baseball world. As the baseball instructor deems them to be nothing but trash, he informs the team that they will be disbanded in one month \u2013 that is, until one of the players begs him to let them play a single game. They\u2019ll be up against the first team, and if they win, they\u2019ll get to take over the title and even work their way towards playing at Koshien Stadium. With the help of Kaido, an ex-member of the first team, Asunaro and his friends will do whatever it takes to show they\u2019re more than meets the eye!\n\n(Source: Anime-Planet)",
